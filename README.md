This is a simple FAQ Chatbot application written in Python. It answers frequently asked questions based on a predefined set of responses.

I'm excited to share that I've completed my FAQ Chatbot Project as part of my internship.

**What I've done so far:**

◆ Designed and implemented a user-friendly FAQ Chatbot using Python and Tkinter for a graphical interface  
◆ Collected and organized frequently asked questions (FAQs) on a specific topic/product  
◆ Developed the core logic to match user queries with the most relevant FAQ using simple string matching  
◆ Enabled dynamic chatbot responses based on user input  
◆ Added features like theme switching (Light/Black), color-coded chat, and a clear button for better usability  
◆ Explored GUI development and user experience design in Python

**This task helped me:**
- Strengthen my Python programming skills
- Learn about GUI application development with Tkinter
- Understand the basics of chatbot logic and user interaction

**Tools & Libraries used:**  
- Python  
- Tkinter (for GUI)  

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   - Windows: `python -m venv venv && .\venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install dependencies:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the chatbot:
   - `python main.py`

## Features
- Answers common questions from a FAQ database
- Easy to extend with more questions and answers

## File Structure
- `main.py`: Main script to run the chatbot
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
